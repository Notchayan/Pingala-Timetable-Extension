# Pingala-Timetable-Extension
A chrome extension for automating scheduling for IITK students.<br>
<b>Changes : </b>
1. Added a personalised user dashboard displaying the user's display picture and various details including Name, Roll number, Programme and
department, Semester, Applied credits.<br>
2. Changed the font from Arial to Quicksand from google fonts.<br>
<br>
<b>Potential Issues : </b><br>
   The only issue that I was not able to resolve is that the user dashboard is not displayed on the first launch of the extension. But it works fine after
   closing and reopening the extension. Although it can be neglected as once the user clicks on update timetable, the extension closes on itself, and the
   user anyway has to reopen the extension, after which the dashboard is working properly.
